This article assumes you are on windows 10 and using Python 3.10 from the Microsoft Store

Begin in the terminal typing the following.
```
python3 -m venv app  
```
This should have created a folder called "app" with a virtual environment. VSCode will ask you if you want to activate the environment. If you are unable to activate the environment then type the following depneding on your terminal environment.

If Powershell, first change directory in the terminal to use the app folder (or whatver your project is called)
```
cd app
```
then activate
```
Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
If command prompt (CMD), first change directory in the terminal to use the app folder (or whatver your project is called)
```
cd app
```
then activate
```
Scripts/activate.bat
```
Be sure to copy and create a .gitignore file for your directory to not commit unnecessary files

We can also look at the bottom right of VSCode and change the interpreter path.

# Installing Requests 

```
pip install requests
```

Pip allows us to install outside packages for our apps. 
Ensure that after installing and importing in your .py file that there are no underlines indicating the package is not found. If it is not found you are not active in the virtual env. 

# Running the file
You will now likely need to use 
``` cmd 
python app.py
```

in order to run the file. Keep in mind the location of the file relative to your terminal

following might be needed.
```
cd ../
```

Directions: Select an API and build a project around that. The project must show the user some data from the API in a manner that is easy to read. You have a large degree of freedom of what the project is. User should be able to request and view different types of data through the terminal. Example, show users some stock data. Then allow users to search for new stock data, sort stock data etc. 
We will also be leveraging Tkinter for this project
For leveraging Tkinter I will be allowing the use of an AI assistant but you must save your prompts. All prompts must ONLY be related to tkinter and not the logic of the application. You can copy and paste your prompts and the AI response into a google doc to be shared with me at the end of the project. See my example below.
